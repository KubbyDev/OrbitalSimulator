Systems are ways to create more complicated programs for the board computer to execute.
To create a system, create a new class in this package and make it extend ComputerSystem.

Then you can create methods. To create a method callable by the computer, make it public void with String[] as parameter
Don't forget to mark it with the SystemMethod annotation

package orbitalsimulator.physics.module.modules.boardcomputer.systems;
import orbitalsimulator.physics.module.modules.boardcomputer.ComputerSystem;
import orbitalsimulator.physics.module.modules.boardcomputer.SystemMethod;
public class TEST extends ComputerSystem {
    @SystemMethod
    public void test(String... args) {
        System.out.println("System Call: " + args[0]);
    }
}

And that's it!
To call your method in the computer program, juste write SystemName MethodName Parameter1 Parameter2 ...
For this example: TEST test hello

Additionnal information:
You can create helper methods that can't be accessed by the computer, just don't mark them with SystemMethod
You can access the BoardComputer object that holds your system with this.parentComputer
Each board computer has an instance of your system, so they work independently
You can override update() to update your system at each update of the parent computer
